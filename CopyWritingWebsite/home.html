        <h3>Example Copy</h3>
        <p>Effective ads and sales pages must be specific to target market.<br><br>We want to pique curiosity, emotion, or relate to the reader through story.<br><br>Imagine an ad for a workout program targeted towards 30-40 year old men that started gaining too much weight for their liking, and then they read this: <br><hr><br>
        
        This was a <span>MONUMENTAL</span> discovery.<br><br>

        I have been self-conscious about my appearance in the mirror for as long as I can remember.<br><br>

        No matter which diet plan or training routine I tried, I simply could not attain the body I desired.<br><br>

        I would engage in endless cardio and follow miserable diets, yet nothing seemed to make a difference.<br><br>

        But then, I came across the <span>game-changer.</span><br><br>

        The fat began melting away.<br><br>

        I was actually able to enjoy my meals.<br><br>

        I would spend less than 30 minutes in the gym each day.<br><br>

        I cracked the code for transforming your physique!<br><br>

        <br><hr><br>
        
        This would be a story that relates to many of the target audience, exposes their pain, and teases the solution. <br><br>
        
        The power of story, curiosity, and emotion are <span>powerful</span>!<br><br>
        
        We can customize your approach for ads and driving sales depending on your target audience. Each market is quite different.
